===================================================================================================

The system has two entry points: 

 -- main: creates players and hands references to dealer;
 -- server: gathers connections from external players and hands appropriate proxy players to dealer.

The major systems components are: 

 dealer: knows everything (or knows who knows)
    -- the deck of _cards_ 
    -- references to the _external players_
    -- the food at the _watering hole_
    -- all player's exact current state via _iplayer_ representations plus 
          -- their position in the turn order 
          -- their position in the feeding order 
    and watches over adherence to rules (or has means to do so)

 iplayer: represents total knowledge about one external player 
    -- the cards 
    -- the number of food tokens acquired 
    -- the constructed species 
       	   -- their ordering 
   and it manages the communication between the dealer and the external player, 
    -- a reference to the external player 

 xplayer: represents the game strategy (AI) as developed by competing sw devs
   and gets to know the public state of the game at appropriate points 
   -- current cards (set)
   -- species boards (sequence)
   -- amount of food collected 

 board: represents the knowledge about a species
    -- its traits
    -- body size 
    -- its population 
    -- its food 
    -- the amount of fat food, if it has the fat-tissue trait
